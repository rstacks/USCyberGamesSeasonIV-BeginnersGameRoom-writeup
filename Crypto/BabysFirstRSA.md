We are provided with the file out.txt, which contains the flag encrypted with RSA. This file also
provides the values of n and e. These values are small enough to decrypt the flag with no
additional information. I used https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher to get the flag. After entering the
given information from out.txt, the flag was revealed.

flag: SIVBGR{D0nt_F0rg37_T0_P4D!!!}
