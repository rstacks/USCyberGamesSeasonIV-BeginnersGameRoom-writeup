We are provided with the file challenge.txt. Similar to the Baby's First RSA challenge, this file
contains the flag encrypted with RSA and the values of n and e. Like with Baby's First RSA, these
values are small enough to decrypt the flag with no additional information. Using
https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher, I entered in the provided information and got the flag.

flag: SIVBGR{h1dd3n_f4c70r5}
