Split array in half, then reverse the second half:
[55, 33, 52, 40, 35, 56, 86, 90, 66, 111, 81, 26, 23, 75, 
							  109, 26, 88, 90, 75, 67, 92, 25, 87, 88, 92, 84, 23, 88]
							  88, 23, 84, 92, 88, 87, 25, 92, 67, 75, 90, 88, 26, 109]
[55, 33, 52, 40, 35, 56, 86, 90, 66, 111, 81, 26, 92, 75, 88, 23, 84, 23, 88, 87, 25, 92, 67, 75, 90, 88, 26, 109]


Perform three swaps in reverse order of when they occured in pyrev.py:
[55, 33, 52, 40, 35, 56, 86, 90, 81, 111, 66, 26, 92, 75, 88, 23, 84, 23, 88, 87, 25, 92, 67, 75, 90, 88, 26, 109]
[55, 33, 52, 40, 35, 56, 111, 90, 81, 86, 66, 26, 92, 75, 88, 23, 84, 23, 88, 87, 25, 92, 67, 75, 90, 88, 26, 109]
[56, 46, 59, 39, 44, 55, 96, 85, 94, 89, 77, 21, 83, 68, 87, 24, 91, 24, 87, 88, 22, 83, 76, 68, 85, 87, 21, 98]

Perform bitwise XOR of 15 with all array elements, then add 27 to all elements:
[83, 73, 86, 66, 71, 82, 123, 112, 121, 116, 104, 48, 110, 95, 114, 51, 118, 51, 114, 115, 49, 110, 103, 95, 112, 114, 48, 125]

Decode elements into ASCII text:
SIVBGR{pyth0n_r3v3rs1ng_pr0}
