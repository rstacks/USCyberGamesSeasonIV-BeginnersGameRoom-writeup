# Season IV, US Cyber Open: Beginner's Game Room Writeup

I participated in the Beginner's Game Room as part of Season IV of the [US Cyber Open](https://www.uscybergames.com/). This was a week-long CTF competition that ran from 5/31/2024 through 6/9/2024.
This was my second ever CTF, and while I was only able to solve about half of the challenges, I had a blast and boosted my skills tremendously.

Below, you'll find writeups for all of the challenges I completed. I am also including writeups for incomplete challenges that I attempted. If you're curious about my results in the competition, you can find that information below my writeup links.
