# Season IV, US Cyber Open: Beginner's Game Room Writeup

I participated in the Beginner's Game Room as part of Season IV of the [US Cyber Open](https://www.uscybergames.com/). This was a week-long CTF competition that ran from 5/31/2024 through 6/9/2024.
This was my second ever CTF, and while I was only able to solve about half of the challenges, I had a blast and boosted my skills tremendously.

Below, you'll find writeups for all of the challenges I completed. I am also including writeups for incomplete challenges that I attempted. Information on my results in the competition and the software I used can be found below my writeup links.

## Software and Tools

I used my laptop with [Ubuntu 22.04](https://ubuntu.com/desktop) for this competition. I also used [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) through [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for tools like Burp Suite and Wireshark. Here is a short
list of some of the tools I used for this competition:
- [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/): Great for cryptography challenges.
- [dogbolt.org](https://dogbolt.org/): The Decompiler Explorer. Great for analyzing executables for reverse engineering challenges.
- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload): Enables interception of web requests and provides other web exploitation tools.
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/): Provides lots of options for analyzing network packets.
